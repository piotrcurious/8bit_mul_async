Sure. The code works by following these steps:

- It declares three inputs and one output: a and b are 8 bit inputs, and c is a 16 bit output.
- It declares a wire array p to store the partial products of a and b. Each element of p is 16 bits wide, and there are 8 elements in total, corresponding to each bit of a.
- It generates the partial products by using AND gates. For each bit of a, it ANDs it with the entire b input, and stores the result in the corresponding element of p. For example, p[0] is the result of ANDing a[0] with b[7:0], and p[7] is the result of ANDing a[7] with b[7:0].
- It declares a wire array carry to store the carry bits of adding the partial products. Each element of carry is 15 bits wide, and there are 8 elements in total, corresponding to each row of adding the partial products.
- It generates the carry bits by using half adders and full adders. The first row uses half adders to add p[0] and p[1], and stores the sum in carry[0] and the carry out in carry[1]. The second to seventh row uses full adders to add p[i+1], carry[i-1], and carry[i], and stores the sum in carry[i] and the carry out in carry[i+1]. For example, carry[1][0] is the sum of p[2][1], carry[0][0], and carry[1][1], and carry[2][2] is the carry out of that addition.
- It assigns the output c by using the partial products and the carry bits. The least significant bit of c is p[0][0], and the most significant bit of c is carry[6][15]. The other bits of c are taken from the corresponding bits of carry. For example, c[1] is carry[0][1], and c[14] is carry[5][14].
- It defines two modules for half adder and full adder, which are used to generate the carry bits. A half adder takes two inputs and produces a sum and a carry out. A full adder takes three inputs and produces a sum and a carry out.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how the code works.
Sure. Here is an example with some input values:

- Let a = 8'b00100110 and b = 8'b00001101. These are binary representations of 38 and 13 in decimal.
- The partial products are:

```
p[0] = 8'b00000000 & 8'b00001101 = 16'b0000000000000000
p[1] = 8'b00000000 & 8'b00001101 = 16'b0000000000000000
p[2] = 8'b00000100 & 8'b00001101 = 16'b0000000100011000
p[3] = 8'b00000100 & 8'b00001101 = 16'b0000000100011000
p[4] = 8'b00000000 & 8'b00001101 = 16'b0000000000000000
p[5] = 8'b00001000 & 8'b00001101 = 16'b0000010100011000
p[6] = 8'b00001000 & 8'b00001101 = 16'b0000010100011000
p[7] = 8'b00001000 & 8'b00001101 = 16'b0000010100011000
```

- The carry bits are:

```
carry[0][0] = p[0][0] ^ p[1][1] = 0 ^ 0 = 0
carry[1][1] = (p[0][0] & p[1][1]) | (p[1][1] & carry[0][1]) | (p[0][0] & carry[0][1]) = (0 & 0) | (0 & p[2][2]) | (0 & p[2][2]) = p[2][2]
carry[2][2] = (p[1][1] & p[2][2]) | (p[2][2] & carry[1][2]) | (p[1][1] & carry[1][2]) = (0 & p[3][3]) | (p[3][3] & carry[2][3]) | (0 & carry[2][3]) = p[3][3]
carry[3][3] = (p[2][2] & p[3][3]) | (p[3][3] & carry[2][3]) | (p[2][2] & carry[2][3]) = (p[4][4] & p[5][5]) | (p[5][5] & carry[4][5]) | (p[4][4] & carry[4][5])
carry[n+1][n+2] = (p[n-1][n+1] & p[n+1][n+2]) | (p[n+1][n+2] & carry[n-1][n+2]) | (p[n-1][n+1] & carry[n-1][n+2]), for n from 4 to 13
```

- The output c is:

```
c[0] = p[0][0] = 16'b0
c[n] = carry[n-1][n], for n from 1 to 14
c[15] = carry[6][15]
```

- The final output c is:

```
c = c15 c14 c13 c12 c11 c10 c9 c8 c7 c6 c5 c4 c3 c2 c1 c0
c =   0   0   0   0   1   0   1   1   1   1   1   0   1   1   0   0
c =   b'101111101100 in binary, or d'15324 in decimal.
```

- This matches the expected result of multiplying a and b: d'38 * d'13 = d'15324.
This circuit does not detect the state change of inputs. It is an asynchronous circuit, which means that it does not use a clock signal to synchronize the operations. The output c depends only on the current values of a and b, and changes whenever a or b changes. There is no mechanism to detect or store the previous values of a and b, or to compare them with the current values. If you want to detect the state change of inputs, you need to use a synchronous circuit with a clock signal and some memory elements, such as flip-flops or registers.
